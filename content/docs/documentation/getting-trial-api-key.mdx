This guide walks you through the process of signing up for a free trial API key. The trial gives you access to all API endpoints so you can evaluate the service before committing to a paid plan.

## Step 1: Visit the API Page

Go to [whitepages.com/pro-api](https://www.whitepages.com/pro-api) to access the API signup page.

## Step 2: Enter Your Contact Information

The first form requires three pieces of information:

- **Full Name** - Your full name
- **Business Email Address** - A valid business email address (required for trial approval)
- **Phone Number** - Your phone number in the format (555) 555-5555

  personal email increases your chances of trial approval and faster processing.

## Step 3: Provide API Usage Details

After submitting your contact information, you'll be asked to provide more details about your API needs:

  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Keep Your API Key Secure">
  Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control. If your key
  is compromised, contact
  [support@whitepages.com](mailto:support@whitepages.com) immediately.
</Callout>
