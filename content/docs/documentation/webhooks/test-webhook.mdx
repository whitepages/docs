title: Test a Webhook
description: Send a mock event payload to verify your webhook endpoint
---

Use the `POST /v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/test` endpoint to send a mock event payload to your webhook's URL. This lets you verify that your server receives and processes deliveries correctly without waiting for a real event.

## Basic Usage

Send a test delivery to a webhook:

```bash title="Request"
curl -X POST 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/webhooks/wh_abc123/test' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'
```

This sends a mock notification using the webhook's subscribed event type.

## Parameters

| Parameter    | Type   | Required | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event_type` | string | No       | Event type to simulate. Defaults to the webhook's subscribed type. |

## Response

The response tells you whether your endpoint received the delivery successfully:

```json title="Response"
{
  "success": true,
  "delivery": {
    "status_code": 200,
    "response_time_ms": 150,
    "timestamp": "2026-02-27T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "payload": {
    "event_id": "evt_mock_abc123",
    "event_type": "deed.transfer",
    "links": [
      {
        "version": "1",
        "url": "https://api.whitepages.com/v1/events/evt_mock_abc123"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `payload` field shows what was sent to your endpoint. This is a lightweight notification containing the event type and a link to retrieve the full event details using the [Events API](/documentation/events/get-event).

## What Your Endpoint Receives

Your webhook URL receives a POST request with the following payload:

```json title="Webhook delivery payload"
{
  "event_id": "evt_mock_abc123",
  "event_type": "deed.transfer",
  "links": [
    {
      "version": "1",
      "url": "https://api.whitepages.com/v1/events/evt_mock_abc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field        | Type   | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event_id`   | string | Unique identifier for the event                                                                            |
| `event_type` | string | The type of event (see [Event Types](/documentation/events/event-types))                                   |
| `links`      | array  | One or more links to retrieve the full event details via the [Events API](/documentation/events/get-event) |

Each entry in `links` contains a `version` string and a `url` pointing to the full event resource.

<Callout type="info" title="Test Events">
  The event linked in a test delivery is a mock event. Use it to verify your
  endpoint receives and parses the notification correctly, but note that the
  linked event data is synthetic.
</Callout>

## Diagnosing Failures

If `success` is `false`, check the `delivery.status_code` to diagnose the issue:

| Status Code | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`         | Could not connect to your endpoint                      |
| `4xx`       | Your server rejected the request (check authentication) |
| `5xx`       | Your server encountered an error processing the payload |

<Callout type="tip" title="When to Test">
  Run a test delivery after creating a new webhook or updating the delivery URL
  to confirm everything is wired up correctly.
</Callout>
