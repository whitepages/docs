description: Receive real-time property deed notifications delivered to your endpoint
---

The Webhooks API delivers real-time property deed event notifications directly to your HTTPS endpoint, eliminating the need to poll for changes. When a deed transfer, recording, or other deed event occurs in a region you subscribe to, a notification is sent to your server within minutes containing the event type and a link to retrieve the full event details.

## Why Use Webhooks

- **Real-time updates** — Get notified as soon as deed events are recorded, rather than polling the API on a schedule
- **Reduced API usage** — Receive only the events you care about instead of repeatedly querying for changes
- **Regional targeting** — Subscribe to specific counties or states to focus on the markets that matter to your business
- **Lightweight notifications** — Each delivery includes the event type and a link to fetch the full event, keeping payloads small and letting you control when to retrieve details
