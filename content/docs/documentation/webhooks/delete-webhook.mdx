description: Permanently remove a webhook subscription
---

Use the `DELETE /v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}` endpoint to permanently remove a webhook subscription. Once deleted, no further events will be delivered to the endpoint.

## Basic Usage

Delete a webhook subscription:

```bash title="Request"
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/webhooks/wh_abc123' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

A successful deletion returns a `204 No Content` response with no body.

<Callout type="warn" title="Permanent Action">
  Deleting a webhook is permanent and cannot be undone. If you need to
  temporarily stop receiving events, consider updating the webhook's URL to a
  staging endpoint instead.
</Callout>

## Verify Deletion

After deleting, you can confirm the webhook no longer exists by listing your subscriptions:

```bash title="Request"
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/webhooks/' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

The deleted webhook will not appear in the results.

For full request and response schemas, see the [Delete a webhook subscription](/references/webhooks/delete_webhook) API reference.
