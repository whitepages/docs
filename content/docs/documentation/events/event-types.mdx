title: Event Types
description: Understand the different types of property deed events
---

Every event has an `event_type` field that describes the kind of property deed activity it represents. Event types follow a `category.action` format.

## Available Event Types

| Event Type | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deed.*`   | All property deed events, including transfers, recordings, and more |

<Callout type="info" title="Expanding Coverage">
  `deed.*` is currently the only supported event type. Additional event types
  will be added as coverage expands. Subscribe to `deed.*` in your webhook
  subscriptions to automatically receive all current and future event types.
</Callout>

## Using Event Types

### In Webhook Subscriptions

When [creating a webhook](/documentation/webhooks/create-webhook), the `event_type` parameter controls which events are delivered to your endpoint:

```bash title="Subscribe to all deed events"
curl -X POST 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/webhooks/' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://example.com/webhooks/deeds",
    "event_type": "deed.*",
    "region": "county:king_wa"
  }'
```

### In Event Payloads

The `event_type` field appears in every event object, whether retrieved directly or delivered via webhook:

```json title="Event type in payload"
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "object": "event",
  "event_type": "deed.*",
  ...
}
```

## Distinguishing Test Events

Events generated by the [test webhook endpoint](/documentation/webhooks/test-webhook) include a `"test": true` field. Real events do not include this field. Use it to filter test events in your processing pipeline.
