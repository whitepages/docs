description: Retrieve and understand property deed events from the Whitepages API
---

Events represent property deed activities — transfers, recordings, and other deed transactions — captured from county recorder offices across the United States. Each event contains structured data about the property, the parties involved, and the transaction details.

Events are the core data delivered by [webhook subscriptions](/documentation/webhooks). You can also retrieve individual events directly using the Events API.
