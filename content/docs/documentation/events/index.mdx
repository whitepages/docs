description: Retrieve and understand property deed events from the Whitepages API
---

Events represent property deed activities — transfers, recordings, and other deed transactions — captured from county recorder offices across the United States. Each event contains structured data about the property, the parties involved, and the transaction details.

When a deed event occurs, [webhook subscriptions](/documentation/webhooks) deliver a lightweight notification containing the event type and a link to fetch the full details. Use the Events API to retrieve the complete event data.
