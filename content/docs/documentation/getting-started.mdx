## Get Your API Key

To access the API, you'll need an API key. Sign up for a **free trial** at [whitepages.com/pro-api](https://www.whitepages.com/pro-api).

<Callout type="warn" title="Keep Your API Key Secret">
  Your API key authenticates all requests and tracks usage for billing. Never
  expose it in client-side code or public repositories. If your key is
  compromised, contact [support@whitepages.com](mailto:support@whitepages.com)
  for a replacement.

## Making Requests

All API requests require your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?name=John%20Smith' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Responses are returned in JSON format. Each successful request that returns data consumes one billable query.
