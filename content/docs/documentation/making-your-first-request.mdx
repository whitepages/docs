### What You'll Need

- Your Whitepages API key (received via email after [signing up for a trial](/documentation/getting-trial-api-key))
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (free download)

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step>
### Download and Open Postman

Download Postman from [postman.com/downloads](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and install it. Create a free account or skip sign-in to continue.

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a New Request

1. Click the **+** button to open a new request tab
2. Make sure **GET** is selected in the dropdown (it's the default)

</Step>

<Step>
### Enter the API URL

Paste this URL into the request field:

```
https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?name=John%20Smith&address.city=Seattle&address.state_code=WA
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Add Your API Key

1. Click the **Headers** tab below the URL field
2. In the **Key** column, enter: `X-Api-Key`
3. In the **Value** column, paste your API key

<Callout type="warn" title="Header Name is Case-Sensitive">
  Make sure to use `X-Api-Key` exactly as shown, with capital X, A, and K.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Send the Request

Click the **Send** button. You should see a JSON response in the panel below.

```json title="Example Response"
[
  {
    "id": "P1234567890",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "current_addresses": [
      {
        "address": "123 Main St, Seattle, WA 98101"
      }
    ],
    "phones": [
      {
        "number": "(206) 555-0198",
        "type": "mobile"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

If you see data like this, your API key is working correctly.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Using cURL (Command Line)

If you prefer the command line, you can use cURL:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?name=John%20Smith&address.city=Seattle&address.state_code=WA' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Troubleshooting

### 403 Forbidden or "Invalid API Key"

- Double-check that you copied the entire API key from your email
- Verify the header name is exactly `X-Api-Key` (case-sensitive)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after your API key

### No Results Found

A 404 response with no results is normal—it means your API key is working, but no records matched your search. Try different search parameters.
