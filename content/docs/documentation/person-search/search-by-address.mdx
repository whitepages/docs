title: Search by Address
description: Find people by current or historical addresses
---

Use address parameters to find people associated with a specific location. By default, searches match only current addresses. Enable `include_historical_locations` to also search historical addresses.

## Basic Usage

Search for people at a specific address:

```bash title="Request"
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?street=123%20Main%20St&city=Seattle&state_code=WA' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

This returns people whose **current address** matches the search criteria.

## Include Historical Addresses

To search both current and historical addresses, set `include_historical_locations=true`:

```bash title="Request"
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?street=123%20Main%20St&city=Seattle&state_code=WA&include_historical_locations=true' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

This returns people who currently live at the address **or** have previously lived there.
