title: Search by Radius
description: Find people within a specified distance of a location
---

Use the `radius` parameter to find people within a specific distance of a location. This enables proximity-based searches, such as finding all people within 10 miles of a given address or city.

## Basic Usage

Search for people within a radius of a location:

```bash title="Request"
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=Seattle&state_code=WA&radius=10' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

This returns people whose **current address** is within 10 miles of Seattle, WA.

## How It Works

When you provide a `radius` parameter along with location information, the API:

1. **Geocodes the location** - Converts your address, city, or ZIP code into geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
2. **Searches by distance** - Finds people whose addresses fall within the specified radius
3. **Returns results** - Ordered by relevance and distance

<Callout type="info" title="Geocoding">
  The API automatically geocodes your location. If geocoding fails (e.g.,
  invalid address), the search gracefully falls back to standard address
  matching without distance filtering.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Search by City with Radius

Find people within 5 miles of downtown Portland:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=Portland&state_code=OR&radius=5' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Search by ZIP Code with Radius

Find people within 1 miles of a specific ZIP code:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?zipcode=98101&radius=1' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Search by Full Address with Radius

Find people within 0.1 miles of a specific street address:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?street=123%20Main%20St&city=Seattle&state_code=WA&zipcode=98101&radius=0.1' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Include Historical Addresses

Find people who currently live or have previously lived within 10 miles of a location:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=Austin&state_code=TX&radius=10&include_historical_locations=true' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Combine with Name Search

Find a specific person within a radius:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?name=John%20Smith&city=Denver&state_code=CO&radius=25' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Location Specification

You can specify the center point for radius searches in several ways:

### Street Address (Most Precise)

Provide a full street address for the most accurate center point:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?street=456%20Oak%20Ave&city=Boston&state_code=MA&radius=5' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### City and State

Use city and state for a broader center point (typically the city center):

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=San%20Francisco&state_code=CA&radius=20' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### ZIP Code

Use a ZIP code as the center point:

```bash
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?zipcode=10001&radius=3' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Callout type="info" title="Geocoding Accuracy">
  - **Street addresses** provide the most precise center point - **ZIP codes**
  use the geographic center of the ZIP code area - **City/State** combinations
  use the city center coordinates For best results, provide as much location
  detail as possible.
</Callout>

## Response

The response format is identical to standard person searches, including all address, phone, and demographic information:

```json title="Response"
[
  {
    "id": "P1234567890",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "aliases": ["Johnny Smith"],
    "is_dead": false,
    "current_addresses": [
      { "id": "A9876543210", "address": "789 Pine St, Seattle, WA 98102" }
    ],
    "historic_addresses": [
      { "id": "A1234567890", "address": "456 Oak Ave, Seattle, WA 98101" }
    ],
    "owned_properties": [
      { "id": "R5432109876", "address": "789 Pine St, Seattle, WA 98102" }
    ],
    "phones": [{ "number": "(206) 555-0198", "type": "mobile", "score": 92 }],
    "emails": ["john.smith@example.com"],
    "date_of_birth": "1985-03-15",
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johnsmith",
    "company_name": "Acme Corp",
    "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    "relatives": [{ "id": "P0987654321", "name": "Jane Smith" }]
  }
]
```

<Callout type="info" title="Distance Not Included">
  The response does not include the calculated distance from the center point.
  Results are ordered by relevance score, which factors in distance along with
  other matching criteria.
</Callout>

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

If the location cannot be geocoded (e.g., invalid address or service unavailable), the API automatically falls back to standard address matching without distance filtering:

```bash
# If geocoding fails, this behaves like a standard city/state search
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=InvalidCity&state_code=XX&radius=10' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Radius Too Large

Requests with radius values exceeding 100 miles will return a validation error:

```json title="Error Response"
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Bad Request",
    "long_message": "Request validation failed. Validation failed for field 'query -> radius'. Please check the provided data.",
    "meta": null
  },
  "wp_trace_id": "10860e0010134c52833b9a3cdbdacfd3"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Choose Appropriate Radius

- **Urban areas**: Use smaller radii (2-10 miles) for more targeted results
- **Suburban areas**: Use medium radii (10-25 miles) to cover broader regions
- **Rural areas**: Use larger radii (25-100 miles) to account for lower population density

### Combine with Other Filters

Radius searches work well with other parameters:

```bash
# Find people aged 30-40 within 15 miles of a location
curl 'https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?city=Chicago&state_code=IL&radius=15&min_age=30&max_age=40' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Performance Considerations

- Larger radii return more results but will take longer to process
- Combining radius with name or other filters improves performance
- Consider whether you need to use radius or if other filters like city and state would be sufficient

<Callout type="tip" title="Optimization">
  For best performance, combine radius searches with additional filters like
  name, age range, or phone number to narrow down results.
