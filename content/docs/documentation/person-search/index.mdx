<Callout type="info" title="Understanding Phone Scores">
  Each phone number includes a **score** indicating **relative confidence** in
  the record's accuracy. A Higher score means that a number is more likely to be
  accurate than a lower score.

<Callout type="warn" title="Query Parameter Behavior">
  The API uses **AND logic**, meaning all parameters must match. For example,
  `first_name=John` will return records named John.
  `first_name=John&last_name=Smith` will only return those same records that
  also have the last name Smith.
</Callout>

**Example with multiple parameters:**

```
https://api.whitepages.com/v1/person?name=John%20Smith&zipcode=10001
```
