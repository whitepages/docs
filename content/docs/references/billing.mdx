API usage is tracked and billed based on successful requests.

## Billing Rules

| Response Type      | Billable |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| 2xx (Success)      | Yes      |
| 4xx (Client Error) | Yes      |
| 5xx (Server Error) | No       |
| 429 (Rate Limit)   | No       |

<Callout type="info">
  Only requests to Person and Property endpoints are charged. Account endpoints
  are not billable.
</Callout>

## Billable Requests

All `2xx` (success) and `4xx` (client error) responses from Person and Property endpoints are charged to your account.

## Non-Billable Requests

The following responses are **not** charged:

- `5xx` (server error) responses - issues on our end
- `429` (rate limit) responses - when you've exceeded rate limits

## Billing Period

Usage is calculated from the start of the month in UTC time. Your billing cycle resets on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC.

## Usage Reports

Detailed usage reports are available through the [Account Usage](/docs/references/account/get_account_usage_data) endpoint. You can query:

- Daily request counts
- Usage over custom date ranges (up to 90 days)
- Total requests for a time period
