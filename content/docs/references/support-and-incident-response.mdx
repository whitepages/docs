We are committed to keeping the Whitepages API reliable and transparent. This page covers how to get help, what to expect during incidents, and how we handle changes to the API.

## Support Channels

For any questions, issues, or feature requests, reach out through the following channels:

| Channel | Contact                | Use For                                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | support@whitepages.com | General inquiries, account issues, billing questions, API integration help |

<Callout type="info">
  For urgent production issues, email support@whitepages.com with the subject
  line prefixed by **[URGENT]** to ensure priority routing.
</Callout>

## Incident Response Times

We classify incidents by severity. The following are our typical response and resolution times based on current operational metrics. These are not formal SLAs.

Incidents are typically detected and responded to within **30 seconds**, with resolution within **15-30 minutes** depending on the nature of the issue.

<Callout type="info">
  Our automated monitoring systems detect incidents within seconds, enabling
  rapid response across all severity levels.
</Callout>

### During an Incident

When an incident occurs, we follow this process:

1. **Detection** — Our automated monitoring systems detect anomalies and trigger alerts within seconds
2. **Acknowledgment** — The engineering team is immediately engaged
3. **Investigation** — The team identifies root cause and works toward resolution
4. **Resolution** — The issue is resolved and services are verified as operational
5. **Post-mortem** — For Critical and High severity incidents, an internal post-mortem is conducted to prevent recurrence

## Getting Help During an Outage

If you suspect an outage or are experiencing unexpected errors:

1. Email support@whitepages.com with:
   - Your API key identifier (first 8 characters only, never send the full key)
   - The endpoint(s) affected
   - Error responses you are receiving
   - Approximate time the issue started

## Breaking Changes Policy

We avoid breaking changes at nearly all cost. Backward compatibility is a top priority, and our goal is to minimize disruption to your integrations.

### What We Consider a Breaking Change

- Removing or renaming an existing API endpoint
- Removing or renaming a field from a response body
- Changing the type of an existing response field
- Adding a new required parameter to a request
- Changing authentication or authorization behavior
- Modifying error response formats

### What Is Not a Breaking Change

- Adding new optional request parameters
- Adding new fields to a response body
- Adding new API endpoints
- Adding new values to an existing enum field
- Improvements to error messages (text changes only, not format)

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend that your integration ignores unknown fields in API responses.
  This allows us to add new fields without affecting your application.
</Callout>

### Our Commitment

- **Breaking changes are always introduced in a new API version.** Your existing integration continues to work on the current version.
- **No unannounced breaking changes.** Every breaking change is communicated in advance.
- **Minimum 30-day notice** before any breaking change takes effect.
- **Migration guides** are provided for every breaking change with clear before-and-after examples.
- **Deprecation notices** are communicated via email and changelog for endpoints scheduled for removal.
- **Version support** — When a new API version introduces breaking changes, the previous version continues to be supported for at least 3 months.

## Change Notifications

We notify you about critical changes through multiple channels to ensure you never miss an important update.
