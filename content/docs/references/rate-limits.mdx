import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

API usage is rate-limited to ensure system stability and fair usage across all customers.

## Rate Limit Behavior

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with retry information.

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Requests"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  When you receive a 429 response, wait before retrying your request. Implement
  exponential backoff in your application for best results.
</Callout>

## Monthly Query Limits

Your API plan includes a monthly query limit. When exceeded, you will receive:

```json
{
  "message": "Limit Exceeded"
}
```

This indicates you have hit your monthly query limit. You can either:

- Wait until the next month when your limit resets
- Contact support for additional queries or a plan upgrade

## Best Practices

- **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff for 429 responses
- **Cache responses** when appropriate to reduce API calls
- **Monitor usage** via the [Account Usage](/docs/references/account/get_account_usage_data) endpoint
- **Batch requests** where possible to optimize your quota
